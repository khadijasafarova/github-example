# Introduction/Business Problem
As other geographical searching tool Foursquare is very helpful for gaining and analyzing location related issues. Foursquare is a technology company that built a massive dataset of location data. They actually crowd-sourced their data and had people use their app to build their dataset and add venues and complete any missing information they had in their dataset. Currently its location data is the most comprehensive out there, and quite accurate that it powers location data for many popular services like Apple Maps, Uber, Snapchat, Twitter and many others, and is currently being used by over 100,000 developers, and this number is only growing. In case of analyzing neighborhoods of Toronto cities I got maps of different types of venues on cities. And clusters of them. If we have such information stakeholders can choose location easier for their enterprises. And it will be helpful for them. For example if an investor want to open coffee shop he/she can choose easily the place around business centers for this shop.
