# Data (Alaska)
In the creating usuful data for Alaska areas I obtained region datas from wikipedia page (scrapping) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_boroughs_and_census_areas_in_Alaska - after getting data I made some modifications such as choosing needed fields - Names of areas, Regions and Squares of areas. And also replace 'not assigned' type boroughs with neighbourhoods for more accuracy. Later on I got geospatial data (latitude and longtude of locations). Also i found most common restaurants in these areas. After all I created maps via geographical coordinates. Now time to get foursquare data for finding top ten common venues. Then making clusters with 3 common areas and the most common venues. Then showing all of them in mutual map as clustering them.
